# decentralized-escrow
Instead of relying on a middleman like a bank or escrow company, it uses a smart contract on a blockchain to hold funds securely until the agreed conditions (e.g. contributions goals) are met. This ensures trust and fairness without a central authority.

## Why is it important? 
A decentralized escrow service is important because it fundamentally transforms the way transactions are secured, moving away from relying on centralized, fallible institutions towards a transparent, automated, and tamper-proof system.
